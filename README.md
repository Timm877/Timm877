### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Tim
#### I am a master student Artificial Intelligence

My main interests right now are artificial intelligence, the human body, and doing research. I try to combine my interests by working on brain-computer interfaces and projects related to AI for health.
Next to this, I really enjoy learning something new outside of work, like learning a new language, a new sport, or a new skill.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing my master thesis: a Brain-Computer Interface using Deep Learning for upper-limb motor imagery decoding
