### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Tim
#### I am a Msc graduate Artificial Intelligence at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam

My main interests right now are artificial intelligence, the human body, and doing research. I try to combine my interests by working on brain-computer interfaces and projects related to AI for health.
Next to this, I really enjoy learning something new outside of work, like learning a new language, a new sport, or a new skill.

- ðŸ”­ I just finished my master research project which I did in Elche, Spain, developing a brain-computer interface.
- :memo: Currently trying to explain what I learned during my master by writing blog posts on Medium: https://medium.com/@timdb877.
- :earth_americas: Traveled a part of the world at the end of 2022.

## Examples of work
#### Brain-Computer Interface using Deep Learning for upper-limb motor imagery decoding  
<img src="https://github.com/Timm877/Timm877/blob/main/BCI.gif" width="256" >  
My research project for the master Artificial Intelligence at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I worked on real-time upper-limb motor imagery decoding using deep transfer learning approaches to play Space Invaders. Our approach outperformed traditional ML while reducing preparation time due to transfer learning, and may be
used in the future for real-time exoskeleton control.

#### Explainable machine learning prediction of acute kidney injury from intensive care unit data
A project done for the course Machine Learning and Reasoning for Health. We wanted to predict Acute Kidney Injury 24 hours before onset. For this purpose, we build two pipelines, using a XGBoost model (0.74 AUC) and an Autoencoder model (0.87 AUC). For XGBoost, we used LIME to explain predictions. For the Autoencoder, we used a technique called co-activation graphs to get more insights in the model predictions.

#### Improving Embeddings by Augmenting DBPedia with Results of SPARQL Queries
Extracted the paths which resulted from SPARQL queries for DBPedia, and added these to the graph before applying a graph embedding method called RDF2Vec, after which
ML could be applied. We found no significant improvement for downstream ML tasks when compared to not adding the SPARQL queries.
